## Adapter

Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of
incompatible interfaces. 

### When to use

* you want to use an existing class, and its interface does not match the one you need
* you want to create a reusable class that cooperates with classes that don't necessarily have compatible interfaces
